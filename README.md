# THE STORE

## About

This is a fake store website created with `React` + `Redux`. It is a fairly simple store, but it is pretty much fully functional. For full capability it should be connected with an outer database to track warehouse items.
`localStorage` was used for the sake of comfort when using forms and to avoid all these 'OMG' moments.

I know it is not perfect:
1. components could be smaller,
2. I could make a better split between container and presentational components,
3. there could be some filtering options added besides only search,
4. I could still better implement PayPal API to receive a payment ID which could be sent to a buyer. I guess I will do it in the future but for now I feel it should be OK.

### Preview
You can watch working version here:

## Technologies used:
`React` for building an app.
`Redux` for global state management. 
`Netlify forms` for connection :). It works really great. You can use a contact form and item ordering form and I will receive an e-mail.
`PayPal API` I have used it for payment. Currently it is in sandbox mode, so if you have a sandbox account, then you can try it out.
`styled-components` for styling and some animations.
`Pose` from `Popmotion` for animations.

I wanted to make it as fast as possible withoud too much addtional loading time. I optimized images using `Gimp` but due to .png format it is not perfect and you will see a loading screen. Additionally, `Lazy-loading` is used for additional performance boost. 

I am not designer. For this purpose I based heavily on [Snickers eShop â€” UI animations concept](https://dribbble.com/shots/5449304-Snickers-eShop-UI-animations-concept?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=VCSlav&utm_content=Snickers%20eShop%20%E2%80%94%20UI%20animations%20concept&utm_medium=Social_Share) designed by [Slava](https://dribbble.com/VCSlav), which I found on [dribbble](https://dribbble.com/). Please check it out. His designs are super awsome. I also found some inspiration from: [Shopping Cart UI](https://dribbble.com/shots/4828084-Shopping-Cart-UI?utm_source=Clipboard_Shot&utm_campaign=Tamarashvili&utm_content=Shopping%20Cart%20UI&utm_medium=Social_Share) designed by [Giga Tamarashvili](https://dribbble.com/Tamarashvili).

### Routing
For routing served by browser I used `React` router. Transitions made with `Pose` from `Popmotion`.

Server side routing fixed with `_redirects` file.

## Config
The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App + Redux + React Router](https://github.com/notrab/create-react-app-redux).
